VERIFY - A project with several tests of simple rigid body dynamics

The tests currently implemented are (use these names in the experiment_type field of verify.ini):

tumbler - a freely rotating solid body of various shapes. A test of time integration and general dynamics.

collider - a rotating target shape and a moving bullet shape colliding. A test of collision detection and resolution.

incliner - a box on an inclined plane. A test of the friction model. Use up/down arrows to incline/decline the plane (actually the gravity vector).

Controls:
WASD to move
QZ to up/down
Left mouse to rotate
F10 to reset
p to pause/unpause
ESC to quit
