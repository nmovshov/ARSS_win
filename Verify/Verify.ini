; This is the configuration file for program Verify. It's fairly robust but
; don't push it too hard. Adding new keys and sections in any order is fine.
; Try to avoid spurious white spaces in keys and values. The weakest point
; is where numerical values are read as strings, and converted using atof().
; This makes it hard to verify input, as invalid arguments produce implementation 
; dependent results.
;
; You may use ; as a line comment start for numeric properties, but not for string
; properties.
;
; Common parameters like output frequency etc. in the [program] group.
; Simulation options like time step etc. in the [simulation] group.
; Material parameters in the [materials] group.
; PhysX flags and parameters, including scene and actor flags, in the [PhysX] group.
; The [units] group is where you specify physical constants in code units. Note
; that other parameters, such as grain size and density, will play a role in determining
; the forces and and accelerations in a given simulation. Ideally, the numerical values
; of dynamical variables should be in the range of MKS values of "human experience"
; dynamics. This is not a hard requirment though.
; The [scaling] group helps PhysX normalize and set tolerances. I will probably
; have it do double duty as the a replacement to the [units] group in the future.
; UI and visualization parameters in the [glut] group.
