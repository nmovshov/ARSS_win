Test of the engine's forward integration accuracy
-------------------------------------------------
Two unit spheres were set at rest with their centers 8 units apart on the x axis.
Output files track their separation and relative velocity over time.
Runs were made with succesively smaller time steps.
This test shows the limits of a first order forward integrator - it's not great.
