Test of the engine's forward integration accuracy
-------------------------------------------------
Two solid spheres were set at rest with their centers 8 units apart on the x axis.
Outout files track their separation and relative velocity over time.
Runs were made with succesively smaller time steps. The time scale of the dynamics
in code units is ~30.
