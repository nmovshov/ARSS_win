Visual Studio 2010 quirks

On Windows the VS2010 solution ARSS.sln can be used to build and run all projects with one click. Almost. There are a few quirks. In no particular order:

The following properties do not transfer well through the .props file and need to be set individually for new projects.

Pre-build events: command line
echo del "$(OutDir)*.dll"
del "$(OutDir)*.dll"

Post-build events: command line
echo copy "$(CudaToolkitBinDir)\cudart*.dll" "$(OutDir)"
copy "$(CudaToolkitBinDir)\cudart*.dll" "$(OutDir)"
echo copy "$(SolutionDir)extern\glut\win32\lib\glut32.dll" "$(OutDir)"
copy "$(SolutionDir)extern\glut\win32\lib\glut32.dll" "$(OutDir)"
echo copy "$(SolutionDir)extern\DevIL\win32\lib\*.dll" "$(OutDir)"
copy "$(SolutionDir)extern\DevIL\win32\lib\*.dll" "$(OutDir)"
echo copy "$(SolutionDir)extern\PhysX\v3.2.0_win\Bin\win32\*.dll" "$(OutDir)"
copy "$(SolutionDir)extern\PhysX\v3.2.0_win\Bin\win32\*.dll" "$(OutDir)"

General: Character set - Not Set

Build order: in some situations compiling several projects ar once can cause build order clashes. The projects are independent anyway and there is little reason to load and compile two at once.
