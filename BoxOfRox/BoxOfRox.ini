; This is the configuration file for program BoxOfRox. It's fairly robust but
; don't push it too hard. Adding new keys and sections in any order is fine.
; Try to avoid spurious white spaces in keys and values. The weakest point
; is where numerical values are read as strings, and converted using atof().
; This makes it hard to verify input, as invalid arguments produce implementation 
; dependent results.
;
; You may use ; as a line comment start for numeric properties, but not for string
; properties.
;
; Common parameters like output frequency etc. in the [program] group.
; Simulation options like time step etc. in the [simulation] group.
; Material parameters in the [materials] group.
; PhysX flags and parameters, including scene and actor flags, in the [PhysX] group.
; A -1 here usually translates to "use SDK defaults."
